# Eat05 React

React learning project. A simple, React-based frontend for my Eat05 API. Collaborators and pull requests welcome. 

## Getting Started 

Not much here yet except an HTML file. Assets coming soon. An assortment of JS tools probably coming soon too :P 

You can always fire up a static HTTP server using your favorite language:
